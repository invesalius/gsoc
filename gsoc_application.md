# InVesalius GSoC 2024: Guidelines and instructions #
# Before you apply #

* All projects assume familiarity with Python (and several packages). Aspiring applicants are encouraged to learn it and try to write some code.

* Carefully read the GSoC eligibility rules (see [section 7.1 of the GSoC rules](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/rules)).

* Choose one of the [project ideas](https://github.com/invesalius/gsoc/blob/main/gsoc_2024_ideas.md). We are also open to new ideas. In this case write to us at [paulojamorim@gmail.com](mailto:paulojamorim@gmail.com) with the subject "GSoC 2024: New Idea".

* IMPORTANT: In order to apply, contact the mentors and follow the steps below. **Remember to submit your final proposal before the deadline on April 2nd, 18:00  (UTC).**

# Applying #

If you are interested in applying, follow these steps ASAP:

### 1. InVesalius development environment ###

1.1 - Fork the InVesalius source code from GitHub;

1.2 - Install and run InVesalius from its source code in your PC;

1.3 - Record a short video running InVesalius from its source code.

* In your video, make sure to show the terminal/command prompt by calling InVesalius and loading a sample image (there are some DICOM images at [https://invesalius.github.io/download.html](https://invesalius.github.io/download.html))

* Save your video file in the MP4 format to upload it to Google Drive (step 3).


### 2. Write a working code sample relevant for the proposed project ###

Applicants are welcome to find and fix bugs in InVesalius core or related to some of the proposed projects. However, getting reviews can take a long time as code owners may be busy working on new features. So, instead of requiring applicants to fix a good first bug, **we suggest that applicants write a working code sample relevant for the proposed project**.

The code sample can be attached to the application as a [secret gist](https://gist.github.com/) (please use secret gists, and do not share these with other applicants). Suggested ideas below include proposed "Good Sample Projects":

* Create unit tests to some methods or functions;

* Add type information to some methods or functions;

* Create a simple plugin to apply (example: [erosion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erosion_(morphology)) or [dilation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dilation_(morphology)) to the current mask):

    * [Sample plugins](https://github.com/tfmoraes/inv3_plugins_examples)

    * [Slides](https://github.com/tfmoraes/inv3_plugins_examples/blob/main/slides.html)


We want to see you can code something relevant -- and that this sample code can run and do something non-trivial. Be aware that we have a limited number of mentors available, and will only be able to accept a few applicants.



### 3. Write and share the draft proposal and other files ###

Applicants are encouraged to submit draft proposals, linking to Google Drive with permission for mentors to comment.

Introduce yourself and send the link to the mentor's email. Use "GSoC 2024: Application" as the message subject. Use this email topic for future discussions during the application, .


The Google Drive folder must be named with the following pattern "GSoC2024_LastName_FirstName" and must contain the following files:

* **proposal:** A Google doc with the draft proposal.

* **resume.pdf:** A PDF file with your resume.

* **screenshot.mp4:** The screenshot video from item 1.

* **gist.txt:** A text file with a link to your secret gist from item 2.

The draft proposal must contain the topics below. Try to detail as much as possible.


* **Name and Contact Information**

* **Project Title**

* **Synopsis**

* **Benefits to Community**

* **Technical Proposal**: Provide a proposal of a technical solution with your methodology.

* **Schedule / Deliverables**: Create a schedule that you are sure you will be able to accomplish. Set checkpoints each two weeks.

* **Related Work**

* **Biographical Information**

* **Expectations after the end of GSoC 2024** 

**IMPORTANT:** Use [this template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1F6y3brsEIHcQB-BxpDD8LxyKV7qHUycSY7titupEhx0). Make a copy for your Google Drive.

See also the [contributor guide](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/student/writing-a-proposal) on writing a proposal.


### 4. Final submission ###

After following steps 1, 2 and 3 with your potential mentor, applications can be submitted through the [summerofcode.withgoogle.com](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com) website starting on March 18th until [April 2nd at 18:00 (UTC).](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/timeline?hl=en)


### 5. Cross your fingers ###

According to the [calendar](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/timeline?hl=pt-br#may_4_-_1800_utc), the result will be announced on May 4th.
